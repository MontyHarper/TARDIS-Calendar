# TARDIS Calendar
This is an experimental "dementia" calendar for iOS, currently in development.

# TARDIS Calendar Concept
I'm designing this calendar for my mom, who has temporal lobe epilepsy, and cannot conceptualize time very well.
Other "dementia clocks" or calendars all seem to work on the same pricipal, which is to present lots of information on a big screen about what time it is now.
For my mom, the current time doesn't answer many of her questions. What she really needs is a way of anchoring herself in relation to future events.
The TARDIS calendar represents the flow of time graphically on screen. 
(So "Time and Relative Dimension In Space" kind of makes sense. I may change it to TARDOS - Time and Relative Dimension On Screen.)
In addition, my mom does not work well with technology, and cannot learn to navigate a new app, so 
the calendar is presented in a single view, and the user controls are very simple and intuative.

# Future Plans / Please Contact Me
I imagine there are others out there whose needs are similar, so I plan to make this app available when it's ready.
If you have a loved-one who struggles with the concept of time and might benefit from my approach, please contact me. 

# Basic Features
- Current day, date, and time are prominantly displayed.
- Backdrop is a color gradient representing sunrise, sunset, day and night.
- "Now" icon shows the user's face at the current moment in the timeline.
- Future events represented on the timeline scroll toward the Now icon from right to left in real time.
- Time intervals are labeled relative to Now.
- Tapping an event shows a countdown clock to that event.
- User can zoom in and out by dragging a finger.
- Caregiver can adjust settings with a menu not easily accessed by the user.
- The TARDIS calendar draws events from Apple's Calendar app.
- Caregivers can easily add or edit events via their shared Apple Calendar.
